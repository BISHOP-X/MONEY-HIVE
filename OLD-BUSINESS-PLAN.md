**INTRODUCTION**

**Executive Summary**
Money Hive is a next-generation digital remittance and bills payment platform designed to empower the global diasporan by providing a seamless, fast, and cost-effective way to send money and pay for essential services back home. Built with cutting-edge financial technology, Money Hive bridges the gap between diaspora communities and their families by facilitating secure, low-cost transactions with unmatched convenience.

**Problem Statement**
Millions of Africans living abroad struggle with high remittance fees, slow processing times, and unreliable services when sending money to their loved ones or paying for critical expenses such as utility bills, tuition, and healthcare.

(Explanation: CAGR is a way to measure the average annual growth of an investment over a period. It's a reliable method for calculating the returns on an investment. CAGR considers the time value of money, which makes it more accurate than absolute return. CAGR is useful for smoothing out the volatility of year-to-year growth.
