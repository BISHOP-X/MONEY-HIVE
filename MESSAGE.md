**Progress Update - Jan 28**

Removed the 3D globe, optimized the bundle (6.5x smaller - from 359KB to 55KB), fixed all UI issues (header bar, page transitions, mobile responsiveness), and structured the entire backend architecture with mock services that are ready to swap for real APIs. Also gathered and documented the API structures for Flutterwave, Nium, and ComplyCube in `docs/`. Frontend is production-ready and performs smoothly on both desktop and mobile - just waiting on API credentials to plug in and test.
